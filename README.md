Program to convert positive numbers in the range [0, 2^31)
from decimal to binary

Once the file has been added to your directory, compile and
run from the command line with the following command:

    $ gcc convert.c -lm -std=c99 -o convert
    $ ./convert [number]

This program was created mainly as a sample of how I like to
solve problems using code. This program was inspired by my
struggles with converting numbers between decimal, binary,
and hexadecimal in my computer organization class in college. 
All of the projects for said class had to be written in C, so 
I figured I would follow suit as well as add a little extra 
challenge for this project by writing it in C rather than my 
preferred language, C++. 

Happy converting! :)
